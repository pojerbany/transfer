The IT risk is effectively lowered through the combined use of Tanium agent (Endpoint Detection and Response - EDR), Puppet (configuration manager), Splunk (Security Information and Event Management - SIEM), and an isolated network through the following mechanisms:

Tanium Agent (EDR):

Real-time Visibility: Tanium provides real-time visibility into endpoints, enabling rapid detection and response to potential security threats.
Endpoint Security: The agent enhances endpoint security by continuously monitoring for anomalies and suspicious activities, reducing the risk of undetected threats.
Puppet (Configuration Manager):

Consistent Configuration: Puppet ensures consistent and secure configurations across IT infrastructure, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities due to misconfigurations.
Automated Compliance: Configuration management through Puppet automates compliance checks, lowering the risk of non-compliance with security policies and standards.
Splunk (SIEM):

Centralized Monitoring: Splunk centralizes log data and provides real-time analysis, enhancing the ability to detect and respond to security incidents promptly.
Threat Intelligence: Splunk's SIEM capabilities integrate threat intelligence, improving the organization's ability to identify and mitigate potential risks based on known threat indicators.
Isolated Network:

Segmentation of Resources: An isolated network adds an extra layer of security by segmenting resources, limiting lateral movement for potential attackers and reducing the attack surface.
Containment of Threats: In the event of a security incident, an isolated network helps contain the impact, preventing the spread of threats to critical systems.
In summary, the Tanium agent provides real-time endpoint visibility and response capabilities, Puppet ensures consistent and secure configurations, Splunk centralizes monitoring and enhances threat detection, while an isolated network adds an additional layer of defense by segmenting and containing potential threats. Together, these measures collectively contribute to lowering IT risk by proactively addressing vulnerabilities, improving detection capabilities, and minimizing the impact of security incidents.
