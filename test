Document Scope and Purpose
This document provides a high-level overview of the break glass procedure. The information in the chapters below is intended to outline general processes, roles, and guidelines for emergency access to critical systems. Detailed, technology-specific action plans and procedures are outside the scope of this document and will be addressed in separate, technology-specific documentation. This ensures that each system’s unique requirements and configurations are properly accounted for in their respective action plans.

Chapter: Break Glass Procedure
1. Overview of Break Glass Procedure
Purpose: Explanation of why the break glass procedure exists, emphasizing its role in providing secure emergency access to critical systems during exceptional situations.
Scope and Applicability: Define the range of systems covered by the procedure, emphasizing that it applies only to critical assets and is activated only when no other access methods are viable.
2. Roles and Responsibilities
Authorized Personnel: Outline who is permitted to initiate, approve, and carry out the break glass procedure (e.g., System Administrators, Security Officers, Compliance Officers).
Responsibilities: Define the specific tasks each role performs during a break glass event, such as initiating requests, monitoring access, and ensuring compliance.
Escalation Paths: Describe who should be contacted and what steps to take if issues arise or if extended access is needed.
3. Activation Criteria
Conditions for Initiating Break Glass: Outline specific scenarios that may warrant the activation of the break glass procedure, such as critical outages, security incidents, or loss of access to essential authentication systems.
Approval Process: Define the decision-making process, including required approvals and documentation to justify activating the procedure.
4. Break Glass Access Process
Step-by-Step Procedure:
Request: Define how requests for break glass access are submitted, documented, and tracked.
Approval: Describe the required approvals and verification steps to authorize break glass access.
Execution: Outline the steps to grant and monitor access, emphasizing security controls such as logging, multi-factor authentication, and real-time monitoring.
Termination: Explain how and when access should be revoked once the emergency is resolved, including the process for documenting the closure of the event.
Security Controls: Detail the security requirements (e.g., logging, monitoring, access reviews) to ensure break glass access is tightly controlled and auditable.
5. Post-Incident Review and Documentation
Review Process: Describe the process for reviewing break glass events after they occur to assess effectiveness, compliance, and security.
Documentation Requirements: Specify the required records (e.g., request forms, logs, approvals) that should be retained for each event to support auditing and compliance needs.
Continuous Improvement: Outline how findings from post-incident reviews should be used to update and improve the break glass procedure.
6. Communication Protocols
Stakeholder Notification: Define who should be informed at various stages of the break glass procedure (e.g., when access is requested, granted, and terminated).
Escalation and Reporting: Provide guidance on when to escalate to higher authorities and how to report the event post-resolution to maintain transparency and accountability.
This structure ensures that readers understand the document’s high-level nature from the outset, with clear direction for where to find detailed, technology-specific procedures if needed. Let me know if this suits your needs or if further refinements are required!
