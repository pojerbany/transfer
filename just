I hope this message finds you well. After careful consideration, I feel compelled to discuss the challenges I have been facing, which regrettably lead me to request a reassignment from the upcoming project.

Family Issues: Recent family matters demand a significant portion of my time and attention, making it challenging to commit fully to the project.

Tight Deadlines: Despite my best efforts, the recent pace of projects and tight deadlines has become increasingly difficult to manage, impacting my ability to deliver quality work.

Bank Process Dependencies: The evolving dependencies within the bank processes have proven more challenging than anticipated, affecting the promised time and effort I can dedicate to the project.

Security Implementation Standards: Learning and implementing the security standards within the banking processes is consuming a significant amount of time, impacting my efficiency in delivering timely and accurate results.

In recent months, I have a strong feeling that my work hasn't been up to the standard, and currently, I have no clear strategy to improve it. In summary, the combination of these factors is producing a level of toxic stress that hinders my ability to contribute effectively to the project. I believe that stepping back from this project is the best course of action to maintain the high standards of our work and ensure that the project is completed successfully. I am open to discussing this further if needed and am committed to a smooth transition.

Thank you for your understanding.
